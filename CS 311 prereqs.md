# Highest priority

Some things I cover either very little or not at all, so students should see them somewhere besides CS 311, or they're never going to see them:

- [OOP](OOP.md) & OO design, including 
	- [[inheritance]]
	- [virtual functions](virtual%20functions.md)
	- [separation of concerns](separation%20of%20concerns.md) and OO-style []
- I/O
	- [Formatted I/O](Formatted%20IO.md)
	- [File I/O](File%20IO.md)]

# High priority

## Nuts and bolts

- [[types]] and [[variables]]
- control flow
	- [[loops]]
	- [[conditionals]]
	- [[functions]]
		- [pass by value](pass%20by%20value.md)
		- [pass by reference](pass%20by%20reference.md)
		- [returning values](returning%20values.md)
- separation of code
	- [header files](header%20files.md) vs [source file](source%20file.md)
	- [[modules]] 

## Standard data structures

They should have seen basic Standard Library data structures 
- std::[[vector]]
- std::[[tuple]]
- std::[[map]] 

## Object-oriented programming

Students should know how to write and use a class:
- class definition
- [access specifiers](access%20specifiers.md)
	- public
	- protected
	- private
- multiple [[constructors]]
- [[destructors]]
- [member data](member%20data.md)
- [[const]] & non-const [member functions](member%20functions.md)
- [static member data](static%20member%20data.md)

# Medium priority

## Multi-file project

Students need to have 
- [written code](write%20code), [built](compile%20code), and [execute](run%20code.md) significant software packages involving
	- classes
	- objects
	- multiple functions
	- multiple code files

## Software design principles

Students should know something about designing software themselves:
- [[modularity]]
- [separation of concerns](separation%20of%20concerns.md)
- [[cohesiveness]]

Students should be able to interface:
- interface with software written by someone else &/or
- implement someone else's design. 

## Testing and debugging

Students should have performed 
- basic [[testing]]
- basic [[debugging]]

## Accessing data

Students know the basics of 
- storing and accessing datasets 
	- in memory
	- in files


# Low priority

Here are a few things that I cover in detail, without assuming much prior experience. I'm generally happier if students have seen them before, but that is not absolutely required:

- [[pointers]]
- built-in [[arrays]]
- [dynamic memory allocation](dynamic%20memory%20allocation.md)
- [[generics|templates]]

# Lowest priority

Some things that I cover in detail, and I think it's fine if students have never seen them before.

- [[exceptions]] & exception safety
- [[RAII]] & resource management
