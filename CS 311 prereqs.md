# Highest priority

Some things I cover either very little or not at all, so students should see them somewhere besides CS 311, or they're never going to see them:

- [[Object-oriented programming]] & OO design, including 
	- [[inheritance]]
	- [[virtual functions]]
	- [[separation of concerns]] and OO-style [[dependency injection]]
- I/O
	- [[Formatted I/O]]
	- [[File I/O]]


# High priority

## Nuts and bolts

- [[types]] and [[variables]]
- control flow
	- [[loops]]
	- [[conditionals]]
	- [[functions]]
		- [[pass by value]]
		- [[pass by reference]]
		- [[returning values]]
- separation of code
	- [[header files]] vs [[source file]]
	- [[modules]] 

## Standard data structures

They should have seen basic Standard Library data structures 
- std::[[vector]]
- std::[[tuple]]
- std::[[map]] 

## Object-oriented programming

Students should know how to write and use a class:
- class definition
- [[access specifiers]]
	- public
	- protected
	- private
- multiple [[constructors]]
- [[destructors]]
- [[member data]]
- [[const]] & non-const [[member functions]]
- [[static member data]]

# Medium priority

## Multi-file project

Students need to have 
- [[write code|written code]], [[compile code|built]], and [[run code|executed]] significant software packages involving
	- classes
	- objects
	- multiple functions
	- multiple code files

## Software design principles

Students should know something about designing software themselves:
- [[modularity]]
- [[separation of concerns]]
- [[cohesiveness]]

Students should be able to interface:
- interface with software written by someone else &/or
- implement someone else's design. 

## Testing and debugging

Students should have performed 
- basic [[testing]]
- basic [[debugging]]

## Accessing data

Students know the basics of 
- storing and accessing datasets 
	- in memory
	- in files


# Low priority

Here are a few things that I cover in detail, without assuming much prior experience. I'm generally happier if students have seen them before, but that is not absolutely required:

- [[pointers]]
- built-in [[arrays]]
- [[dynamic memory allocation]]
- [[generics|templates]]

# Lowest priority

Some things that I cover in detail, and I think it's fine if students have never seen them before.

- [[exceptions]] & exception safety
- [[RAII]] & resource management
